In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to retain cycles.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If you set `myObject` in `AnotherClass` and `anotherObject` in `MyClass`,  a retain cycle occurs. Both objects retain each other, preventing either from being deallocated, even when they're no longer needed. This leads to memory leaks, particularly troublesome in apps running for extended periods.
